# xrpValidators

Front and back build for independent xrpl validator registry


The aim of this project is to create a space for code to be shared
and created to enable individuals to integrate in their own projects
and web apps. With a focus on obataining and sharing data obtained 
from the xrp ledger itself and exploring possibilities for sharing
information to evaluate the verification of validator operators through
various means, web apps, forms etc

I will be utilizing and contributing what we can with the aim to host a
web app @ Repo*.com. A complete version of what will eventually be
on the site will be kept available while appropriate to its content.

Collaboration from the #xrpcommunity will be key to the success of the 
project, if there is something you need to further the capabilities to
evaluate validtor metrics or operater verfication then please make this
known to project contributers, submit a request, or help contibute.
